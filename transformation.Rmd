## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
transform_data <- function(data) {
    data_transformed <- data * 2
    return(data_transformed)
}

# Apply the function to the mtcars dataset
transformed_mtcars <- transform_data(mtcars)
head(transformed_mtcars)  # Display the first few rows of the transformed dataset

transform_data_mean <- function(data_new) {  
    data_mean <- colMeans(data_new, na.rm = TRUE)
    return(data_mean)
}

# Apply the function to the mtcars dataset
mean_mtcars <- transform_data_mean(mtcars)
mean_mtcars  # Display the mean of each numeric column

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
